# hello-world
Greetings earthlings!

Just trying to figure out what I am going to do with github. I have not coded much lately but do occasionally when I need some code and cannot find it already done somewhere, which doesn't happen much these days. Lately I'm mostly trying to find out some things about grbl and candle that I cannot find in the wikis. I'm resorting to looking at code.

Signing off for now.
